# Comaprison between three control algorithm
Objective: Control of a 2-link manipulator and comparing three control algorithms namely PD controller, PD controller with computed torque controller and robust controller (i.e. Adaptive controller) in MATLAB and simulate results and comment on their performance and differences.

- Comparing three controllers 
  - PD controler
  - PD + torque compensation controller
  - Robust control i.e.  Adaptive controller

Long back did this graduate class project which I think was really helful for me to understand advanced control algorithm and its perfomance in different scenario. Sharing this so that others can be benifitted through my work.
