- Comparing 
  - PD controler
  - PD + torque compensation controller
  - Robust control e.g. Adaptive controller
  
Long back did this graduate class project which I think was really helful for me to understand advanced control algorithm and its perfomance in different scenario. Sharing this so that others can be benifitted through my work.
