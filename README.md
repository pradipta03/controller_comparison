# Comaprison between three control algorithm
- Comparing 
  - PD controler
  - PD + torque compensation controller
  - Robust control i.e.  Adaptive controller
 - Check the [presentation pdf](https://github.com/pradipta03/controller_comparison/blob/main/controller_presentation.pdf) for further details, paramter and explanation. 
Long back did this graduate class project which I think was really helful for me to understand advanced control algorithm and its perfomance in different scenario. Sharing this so that others can be benifitted through my work.
